Introduction:

The goal of this project is to use the Javascript library D3 to build an interactive web site
that can display various health risks within each individual state.

Data source:

The data source was downloaded as a CSV off of the US Census bureau's Factfinder website.

Technologies:

Javascript, CSS, Javascipt library (D3), and HTML were used.

Scope:

The data source was based on the 2014 ACS 1 year estimates. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error." This data was used to create a dynamic graph with obesity, smokers, and lack of healthcare on the Y-axis. Poverty, age, and household income was graphed on the x-axis, respectively. The created graph gave us the functionality of clicking on which Y-axis or X-axis variables that we wanted to compare. When the X-axis and Y-axis variables are selected than the graph displays each state. This shows where each state measures for two variables.
